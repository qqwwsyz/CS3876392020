TESTED ON: 6/14/2020

I am Yang Peiying and I tested the app of Chen Zheming.

Chen completed the project on time, I submitted the feedback late.

The code is available at: https://github.com/qqwwsyz/CS3876392020.git.

The minimum SDK of the apk is <15>.
The target SDK of the apk is <29>.

The code, the apk and the 3 screenshots are available at the right location in the GitHub repository.

The code use fragments.

The app has been personalized by the student.But there aren't images that match with each random answer.

I tested the app on phone(s)/tablet(s) (model(s)) / emulator(s) with OS <X>. But xml for Phone_landscape and Tablet_Portrait are missing

The app does not crash.

SMS works. (same for Phone, Web, Map, Share, New Activity, Help). If it does not work, be sure to identify and mention the problem.
Please mention all the problems with the app, what should be improved, and put a general comment. The best thing is to create screenshots to showcase the problems (with explanations).
